/**
 * graphql-casl — generic CASL permissions middleware for GraphQL resolvers.
 *
 * Everything here is schema-agnostic: pass your own generated `Resolvers` /
 * `ResolversTypes` to the type helpers and you get a fully-derived subject
 * union without any manual type listing. The runtime helpers (`createCan`,
 * `createTyped`, `createSubjects`, `accept`, `deny`) are bound to your app's
 * context shape and ability builder at call time.
 *
 * Abilities are statically typed: derive a {@link GraphQLAbility} from your
 * `SubjectMap` and build it with {@link createGraphQLAbility} (or rehydrate
 * stored rules with {@link buildGraphQLAbility}). Conditions use a small,
 * serializable operator language ({@link GqlOperators}) matched by
 * {@link gqlConditionsMatcher}; subjects are detected via `__typename`.
 *
 * Modules:
 * - `schemaTypes` — type helpers derived from generated `Resolvers`/`ResolversTypes`
 * - `rules` — the `graphql-middleware` rule layer (`Rule`, `PermissionsMap`, `applyPermissions`, `accept`, `deny`)
 * - `ability` — CASL `Action` / `Actions` / `AbilityLike`
 * - `graphqlAbility` — the schema-typed `GraphQLAbility` / `createGraphQLAbility` / `buildGraphQLAbility`
 * - `subjects` — `createSubjects` / `createTyped`
 * - `createCan` — the factory tying abilities to rules
