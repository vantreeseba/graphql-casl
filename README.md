# @vantreeseba/graphql-casl

A [`graphql-middleware`](https://github.com/dimagi/graphql-middleware) plugin for
defining [CASL](https://casl.js.org/) permission rules that apply to your GraphQL
resolvers. Declare rules per type/field in a `PermissionsMap`; each rule runs
before the underlying resolver and throws if the request is not allowed.

The library is **schema-agnostic** — the subject names and condition types are
derived from your own generated `Resolvers` / `ResolversTypes`, so there is no
manual type listing.

## Install

```bash
npm install @vantreeseba/graphql-casl
# peer deps
npm install @casl/ability graphql graphql-middleware
```

## Concepts

| Export | What it does |
|---|---|
| `createGraphQLAbility<SubjectMap>()` | Returns a CASL `AbilityBuilder` typed against your schema — `can`/`cannot` conditions are checked against each subject's fields — with the GraphQL conditions matcher and `__typename` detection applied by `build()`. |
| `buildGraphQLAbility<SubjectMap>(rules, options?)` | Rebuilds an ability from stored `GraphQLRule`s (e.g. rules persisted in a database and loaded at startup). |
| `createCan(getAbility, isAuthenticated, buildSubject?)` | Factory that returns a `requireCan(action, subject, getSubjectData?)` rule builder, bound to your context shape and ability builder. |
| `createTyped<SubjectMap>()` | Returns a `typed(type, attrs)` helper that tags plain objects with `__typename` for subject detection. |
| `createSubjects<SubjectMap>()` | Validates a subject-name const object against your schema's domain types. |
| `gqlConditionsMatcher` | The GraphQL conditions matcher (equality + a small operator set), for manual ability construction. |
| `accept` / `deny` | Always-pass / always-fail rule primitives. |
| `Actions` | Const map of `create` / `read` / `update` / `delete` / `manage`. |

Type helpers: `PermissionsMap`, `Rule`, `SubjectName`, `SubjectMap`, `ArgsOf`,
`ParentOf`, `ContextOf`, `Action`, `GraphQLAbility`, `GraphQLAbilities`,
`GraphQLRule`, `GraphQLAbilityOptions`, `GqlConditions`, `GqlConditionsFor`,
`GqlFieldCondition`, `GqlOperators`, `AbilityLike`.

A failed authentication check throws `Not authenticated`; a failed ability check
throws `Forbidden`.

### Conditions

Conditions are a small, **serializable** language (no mongo-query operators). A
field maps to either a bare value (equality) or an operator object:

```ts
can('read', 'Note', { userId });                       // equality
can('read', 'Note', { status: { in: ['draft', 'live'] } });
can('read', 'Note', { version: { gt: 2 }, title: { ne: '' } });
```

Operators: `eq`, `ne`, `in`, `nin`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`. Because rules are
plain JSON, you can store them in a database and rehydrate with
`buildGraphQLAbility` (see [Persisting rules](#5-persisting-rules-optional)).

## Usage

### 1. Build abilities

Bind the generic helpers to your app's generated types and define abilities with
`createGraphQLAbility`. It returns a CASL `AbilityBuilder` typed against your
`SubjectMap`, so `can`/`cannot` conditions are checked against each subject's
fields, and `build()` wires the GraphQL conditions matcher and `__typename`
subject detection for you.

```ts
import {
  Actions,
  createGraphQLAbility,
  createSubjects,
  createTyped,
  type GraphQLAbility,
  type SubjectMap,
} from '@vantreeseba/graphql-casl';
import type { Resolvers, ResolversTypes } from './__generated__/resolvers.js';

export type AppSubjectMap = SubjectMap<Resolvers, ResolversTypes>;
export type AppAbility = GraphQLAbility<AppSubjectMap>;

export const typed = createTyped<AppSubjectMap>();
export const Subject = createSubjects<AppSubjectMap>()({
  User: 'User',
  Note: 'Note',
} as const);

export function defineAbilitiesFor(userId: string | undefined): AppAbility {
  const { can, build } = createGraphQLAbility<AppSubjectMap>();
  if (!userId) return build(); // no rules ⇒ everything denied
  can(Actions.read, Subject.Note);
  can(Actions.update, Subject.Note, { userId }); // typed against Note's fields
  return build();
}
```

### 2. Bind `createCan` to your context

```ts
import { createCan } from '@vantreeseba/graphql-casl';
import type { Context } from './context.js';
import { type AppSubjectMap, defineAbilitiesFor, typed } from './abilities.js';

const canUser = createCan<Context, AppSubjectMap>(
  async (ctx) => defineAbilitiesFor(ctx.userId),
  (ctx) => ctx.userId != null,
  typed,
);
```

### 3. Declare the permissions map

`getSubjectData` builds the subject instance from the resolver args; the subject
name narrows its return to that subject's fields, so annotate `args` with your
generated `*Args` type to type the extraction end to end. Without it the rule
checks against the bare subject type.

```ts
import { accept, deny, type PermissionsMap } from '@vantreeseba/graphql-casl';
import type { Resolvers, MutationUpdateNoteArgs } from './__generated__/resolvers.js';

export const permissions: PermissionsMap<Resolvers> = {
  Query: {
    note: canUser(Actions.read, Subject.Note),
    me: canUser(Actions.read, Subject.User),
  },
  Mutation: {
    requestMagicLink: accept, // public
    deleteNotes: deny,        // nobody, ever
    updateNote: canUser(Actions.update, Subject.Note, (args: MutationUpdateNoteArgs) => ({
      userId: args.userId,
    })),
  },
};
```

### 4. Apply to the schema

```ts
import { applyPermissions } from '@vantreeseba/graphql-casl';

const schemaWithPermissions = applyPermissions<Resolvers>(schema, permissions);
```

`applyPermissions` wraps `graphql-middleware`'s `applyMiddleware` and keeps
`permissions` typed as a `PermissionsMap<Resolvers>`, so a mistyped type or
field name is caught at compile time.

### 5. Persisting rules (optional)

Rules are plain JSON, so they can be stored in a database and loaded/cached at
startup. Read `builder.rules` (or `ability.rules`) to persist them, and rebuild
with `buildGraphQLAbility`:

```ts
import { buildGraphQLAbility, type GraphQLRule } from '@vantreeseba/graphql-casl';

// persist
const { can, build } = createGraphQLAbility<AppSubjectMap>();
can(Actions.update, Subject.Note, { userId });
await db.savePermissionRules(build().rules);

// load (per request or cached)
const rules: GraphQLRule<AppSubjectMap>[] = await db.loadPermissionRules();
const ability = buildGraphQLAbility<AppSubjectMap>(rules);
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test        # run vitest
npm run coverage # run vitest with coverage
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
npm run build   # compile to dist/
npm run check   # biome lint + format check
npm run docs    # generate the Markdown API reference into docs/api/
```

## API reference

Every export carries JSDoc. Generate a full Markdown API reference with
[TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) + the Markdown plugin:

```bash
npm run docs   # writes docs/api/ (git-ignored)
```

The docs are not committed; CI builds them and publishes them to this
repository's [GitHub Wiki](../../wiki) on every push to `main`.

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and
drive automated releases: pushes to `main` run the **Test** workflow, and on
success the **Release** workflow runs [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/)
to version, changelog, publish to npm, and tag a GitHub release.

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for deferred work.
